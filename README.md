When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Madison, classes at the Madison Metropolitan School District became fully online. Students without reliable home access to internet are less able to participate in their classes, and are at risk of falling behind their peers.

While the City of Madison, MMSD, and other local governments are not legally allowed to be direct internet service providers, other entities are exploring providing home internet access to students. They wish to know how their resources could be most effectively deployed to reach the target population.
